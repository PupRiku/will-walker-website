      'Set in the eerie Elsinore Center for Restorative Care, a 1950s asylum, Hamlet: A Horatio Story reimagines Shakespeare’s tragedy through Horatio’s fractured mind. As Hamlet descends into vengeance, Horatio struggles to bear witness, torn between loyalty and a truth distorted by grief. The asylum’s sterile halls mirror Denmark’s decay, where love, betrayal, and madness blur reality. Through Horatio’s eyes, memory and trauma intertwine—are events as they were, or as his mind has reshaped them? This adaptation invites audiences into a world where ghosts linger not just in shadows, but in the depths of the human soul.',

As the arachnids web up the countryside, a ragtag band of unlikely heroes emerges: Jim, a rugged, dad-bod park ranger with great flannel game; Lexi, an eccentric entomologist with a bug problem and a bigger attitude; a no-nonsense troop of Mountain Scouts led by the fierce and tactical Sara; and Ziggy, a blissed-out van-dweller whose new best friend is an actual Flyder named Sticky. Meanwhile, the military wants to torch the town and cover up everything. Survivors flee to the mountains—nudists, ranchers, babies, and all—seeking refuge in abandoned mines. There, secrets are uncovered, alliances are tested, and the only hope of saving humanity may lie in a homemade chemical discovered in a diner and the Girl Scouts' merit badge-level genius. Packed with explosive action, deadpan humor, insectoid chaos, and just the right amount of weed smoke, Flyders! is a horror-comedy thrill ride where the bite is bad, but the buzz is worse.",
